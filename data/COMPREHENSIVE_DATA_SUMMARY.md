ventilation = design_rules[design_rules['Code_Reference'].str.contains('ASHRAE')]
# Office: 5 CFM/person = 250 CFM total outdoor air
```

### **Example 3: Accessible Bathroom Design**
```python
# User input: "Create an ADA-compliant bathroom"

# 1. Code Requirements
ada_bathroom = design_rules[
    (design_rules['Code_Reference'].str.contains('ADA')) & 
    (design_rules['Applies_To'].str.contains('Bathroom'))
